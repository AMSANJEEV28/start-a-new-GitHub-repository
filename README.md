Being a writer who regularly publishes articles, I find that writing is both a passion of mine and a skill that requires ongoing practice. After leaving my position as a content writer, I have made the decision to share what I know on a variety of subjects on LinkedIn. I think doing this will help me both show off my skills and get back into the routine of writing frequently. As a result, my first post on this platform will be about how to start a new GitHub repository.

For hosting and managing the code, developers rely on the hugely popular GitHub website. When beginning a new project or working with others on an ongoing project, it is essential to create a new repository on GitHub. It is a basic procedure that can be finished in a few quick stages.

Logging into your GitHub account is obviously the first step in creating a new repository on the platform. If you don't already have one, you may quickly create one by adhering to the website's instructions. 

After logging in, you may view your dashboard and find a green icon that says "New." To begin creating your new repository, click this button.

The name of your repository will then need to be entered. Pick a name that truly captures the goal of your project. For others who might access your repository, you can also decide to include a brief description of your project.

You can decide whether your repository will be public or private after giving it a name. While private repositories can only be accessed by those you have given access to, public repositories are accessible to anyone who visits your GitHub profile. You can always alter the repository's visibility settings later if you're unclear about which option to make.

Selecting a license is the last step in starting a new repository on GitHub. Although this step is optional, it is strongly advised because it guarantees that others can use and contribute to your project in a morally and legally responsible manner. Picking the right license for your project is crucial because GitHub offers a range of license options.

The "Create repository" button can be clicked to complete the creation of your new repository when you have finished the preceding stages. Congratulations, you've just successfully started a new GitHub repository!

Finally, any developer starting a new project or working with others on an existing project must take the quick and simple process of creating a new repository on GitHub. You can easily build a new repository and start disseminating your code by following these instructions. Happy Coding!
